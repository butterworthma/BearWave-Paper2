# Evaluating NVIS for Remote Wildlife Monitoring: A Field Trial in the Borneo Rainforest

## 📊 Overview
This repository contains the complete analysis code for **"Evaluating NVIS for Remote Wildlife Monitoring: A Field Trial in the Borneo Rainforest"** - a comprehensive study of Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS) communication for wildlife monitoring applications. The code includes ionospheric foF2 (critical frequency) analysis, field test results, and NVIS propagation modeling with data from Guam and Darwin monitoring stations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Generate all 6 standardized charts
python generators/generate_corrected_charts.py

# Run individual analysis
python analysis/guam_april15-28_fof2_7years.py

# Batch process all analyses
python automation/run_all_2x2_charts.py
```
